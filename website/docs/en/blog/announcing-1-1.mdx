Rspack v1.1 has been released!

Notable changes in Rspack v1.1:

- [Performance Improvement](#performance-improvement):
  - [Using Async Thread Pool](#use-async-thread-pool): Significantly improved the performance of make phase of cold starts through more reasonable thread scheduling.
  - [Experimental New Incremental Rebuild](#experimental-new-incremental-rebuild): A new experimental incremental rebuild feature to significantly improved the performance of rebuild.
    - [Incremental Build Chunk Graph](#experimental-incremental-build-chunk-graph): Significantly improved the performance of chunk graph generation of incremental rebuilds through new algorithm.
  - [Bundled Rspack](#bundled-rspack): Bundle `@rspack/core` for faster startup.
- [Exciting New Features](#exciting-new-features):
  - [Improvement of Built-in HTML Plugin](#improvement-of-built-in-html-plugin): Refactored the built-in HTML plugin and support multiple important features.
  - [Improvement of Types](#improvement-of-types): Added JSDoc for all configuration options.
- [Ecosystem Cooperation](#ecosystem-cooperation):

### Experimental New Incremental Rebuild

In the early versions of Rspack 0.x, we implemented [experiments.incrementalRebuild](https://v0.rspack.dev/config/experiments#experimentsincrementalrebuild). As this feature gradually stabilized, we removed the experiments configuration and enabled it by default. However, this feature only enabled incrementality for the `make` and `emitAssets` stages of the rebuild. For many projects, the loader in the `make` stage takes a lot of time. At that time, this feature had a relatively obvious performance improvement in rebuild for these projects. But there are still some projects that take a lot of time in stages other than `make`. Therefore, we optimized and expanded this feature and gradually introduced this feature into other stages, such as `buildChunkGraph`, `providedExports`, `moduleCodegen`, etc. In Rspack v1.1, we introduced [experiments.incremental](https://rspack.dev/config/experiments#experimentsincremental) as the successor and superset of `experiments.incrementalRebuild`, aiming to bring further rebuild performance improvement and faster HMR to developers.

In a case of 10000 React components, the HMR becomes 38% faster:

In Rspack v1.1 you can enable this feature in development mode by:

```js title=rspack.config.js
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV;
module.exports = {
  mode: isDev ? 'development' : 'production',
  experiments: {
    incremental: isDev,
  },
};
```

See [`experiments.incremental`](https://rspack.dev/config/experiments#experimentsincremental) for more details.

This is still an experimental feature and we need more work to stabilize it, but we hope you can try it out and provide us with some bugs and feedback at https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues/8106.

## Exciting New Features

### Improvement of Built-in HTML Plugin

In earlier versions of Rspack, the built-in `HtmlRspackPlugin` was implemented. However, its capabilities were severely lacking. It lacked some configuration options and did not support `hooks`, which made those plugins implemented based on the `hooks` of `HtmlWebpackPlugin` incompatible with Rspack.

Therefore, we refactored `HtmlRspackPlugin`. While supporting most of the configuration options of `HtmlWebpackPlugin`, we also completed the alignment of `hooks`. Now you can get these hooks through `HtmlRspackPlugin.getCompilationHooks` and use them to modify the content of the HTML assets like below:

```js
const AddAttributePlugin = {
  apply: function (compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('AddAttributePlugin', compilation => {
      HtmlRspackPlugin.getCompilationHooks(
        compilation,
      ).alterAssetTags.tapPromise('AddAttributePlugin', async data => {
        data.assetTags.scripts = data.assetTags.scripts.map(tag => {
          if (tag.tagName === 'script') {
            tag.attributes.specialAttribute = true;
          }
          return tag;
        });
      });
    });
  },
};

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new HtmlRspackPlugin(), AddAttributePlugin],
};
```

See [`HtmlRspackPlugin`](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/html-rspack-plugin) for more details

## Migration Guide

### Upgrade the SWC plugins

In version v1.1, the Rust crate `swc_core` has been upgraded to `4.0.2`. Users of the SWC Wasm plugin need to ensure version consistency with `swc_core` being used, otherwise, it may lead to unforeseen issues.

For more details, please see this [document](https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core) of SWCã€‚
